#Stock Portfolio Optimisation

###Introduction

This was a final project for my Algorithms and Data Structures 2 module.

For this project we were given a Data file with all the information about Fortune 500 comapanies and asked to
create an Optimised Stock Portfolio with the lowest volatility and output the amount of stocks to purchase in each company as a Tab Seperated or CSV String that could be placed into an excel spreadsheet and given the overall volatility.

I was ranked in the Top 15 Solutions for my class which gave me an overall ranking of 6th place in my Continous Assessment Grade

###Future Plans
In the future I would like to go back and work on my Object-Oriented and Genetic Algorithm approaches to solving this problem to minimize the volatility of my portfolio even lower.
